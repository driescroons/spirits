- hide leva on prod, not on dev. make it appear using a script
- X make camera follow the player
- X click movement
  - Still scuffed though
- level editor (transform controls?)
- line that follows the player - green is up, red is down - mimicking a graph lol
- player stuff should be calculated with delta
- if moving in a certain direction and jumping, remain the x velocity from before the jump
- force portrait mode
